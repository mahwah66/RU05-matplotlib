This directory contains two notebooks to assess data for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

The notebook "pymaceuticals.ipynb" compares data for four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo).

While working with the data, it became clear that another treatment method not included in that group of four showed promising results. Because of this, I repeated the plots and assessments using the entire field of comparators included in the data sets in the notebook "pymaceuticals_all.ipynb".

Images from each notebook are saved in the images folder.
